Welcome to our IPFS Notebook app! We created this for the hackfs 2021 hackathon. For a demo of how to use the app, please see https://youtu.be/1SP2G0hCOxM.

To run this app, switch to the server folder and run "node index." Then, switch to the root directory and run "npm start." The React front-end will communicate with the server back-end.

The code in this repository will run as is with one minor change. The database credentials in the index.js of the server folder have been scrubbed. Please reach out to team for access to our database credentials to run this locally..

Thanks!
